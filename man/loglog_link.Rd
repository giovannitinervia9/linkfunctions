\title{The Log-Log Link Function}
\usage{
loglog_link()
}
\value{
An object of class \code{"link"} (see \code{\link{link-class}}) containing
the transformation functions and their exact analytical first and second derivatives.
}
\description{
Creates an object of class \code{"link"} implementing the Log-Log transformation.
This link is the symmetric opposite of the \code{cloglog} link and is often used in survival analysis
(Gompertz models) or for modeling binary data with specific asymmetry requirements.
}
\details{
The Log-Log link is defined as \eqn{\eta = -\log(-\log(\theta))}.
The inverse link is \eqn{\theta = \exp(-\exp(-\eta))}.

\strong{Asymmetry:} Unlike the symmetric Logit link, the Log-Log link is asymmetric.
It is suitable for modeling events where the probability approaches 0 slowly but approaches 1 sharply.
This is the mathematical reverse of the \code{\link{cloglog_link}}.

The domain of \eqn{\theta} is \code{(0, 1)}.
