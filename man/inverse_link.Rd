\title{The Inverse (Reciprocal) Link Function}
\usage{
inverse_link()
}
\value{
An object of class \code{"link"} (see \code{\link{link-class}}) containing
the transformation functions and their exact analytical first and second derivatives.
}
\description{
Creates an object of class \code{"link"} implementing the reciprocal transformation.
}
\details{
The Inverse link is defined as \eqn{\eta = 1/\theta}.
The inverse link function is therefore \eqn{\theta = 1/\eta}.

This link is typically used for modeling positive continuous data where the mean is inversely proportional
to the linear predictor.

The domain of \eqn{\theta} is conventionally \code{(0, Inf)}. Care must be taken to ensure the linear
predictor \eqn{\eta} remains strictly positive (or strictly negative) during optimization to avoid division by zero
or mapping to invalid negative parameter values.
