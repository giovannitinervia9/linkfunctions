\title{The Logit Link Function}
\usage{
logit_link()
}
\value{
An object of class \code{"link"} (see \code{\link{link-class}}) containing
the transformation functions and their exact analytical first and second derivatives.
}
\description{
Creates an object of class \code{"link"} implementing the Logit (log-odds) transformation.
This is the canonical link function for success probability parameter of the Bernoulli and Binomial distributions and is the
foundation of Logistic Regression.
}
\details{
The Logit link is defined as \eqn{\eta = \log(\frac{\theta}{1 - \theta})}.
The inverse link is the standard logistic function (sigmoid): \eqn{\theta = \frac{1}{1 + \exp(-\eta)}}.

The link is symmetric around \eqn{\theta = 0.5} (where \eqn{\eta = 0}). It interprets the linear predictor
as the log-odds of the event probability.

The domain of \eqn{\theta} is \code{(0, 1)}.

\strong{Implementation:} This function utilizes R's native \code{qlogis} and \code{plogis} functions to ensure
maximum numerical stability and precision, especially near the boundaries of 0 and 1.
