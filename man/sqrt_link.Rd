\title{The Square Root Link Function}
\usage{
sqrt_link()
}
\value{
An object of class \code{"link"} (see \code{\link{link-class}}) containing
the transformation functions and their exact analytical first and second derivatives.
}
\description{
Creates an object of class \code{"link"} implementing the Square Root transformation.
This is a specific case of the Power link family (with \eqn{\lambda = 0.5}) and is often used
for modeling count data (Poisson) as a variance-stabilizing transformation.
}
\details{
The Square Root link is defined as \eqn{\eta = \sqrt{\theta}}.
The inverse link is \eqn{\theta = \eta^2}.

Unlike the Log link, this transformation allows \eqn{\theta} to reach 0 exactly.
While the inverse function (\eqn{\eta^2}) is mathematically valid for negative \eqn{\eta},
in the context of this link function, the linear predictor \eqn{\eta} is typically constrained to be non-negative
to preserve a one-to-one mapping with \eqn{\theta}.

The domain of \eqn{\theta} is \code{[0, Inf)}.
